Wildlife and Human Detection for Farm Security Using AI
Overview
This repository contains the  resources for a project focused on applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning algorithms to improve security on farmlands by detecting wildlife and humans that pose threats to crops. Fencing and manual surveillance are expensive and time-consuming solutions for farmers, and AI-driven detection systems provide a more efficient, reliable, and cost-effective approach.

In this project, various deep learning models—VGG19, DenseNet, and InceptionV3—are trained and evaluated for their performance in detecting wildlife and human intruders at farm peripheries. The primary goal is to determine which model offers the best accuracy, speed, and adaptability for real-world farm security applications.

Key Highlights:
Models Evaluated: VGG19, DenseNet, and InceptionV3

Dataset: A specialized dataset focused on human and wildlife detection at farm boundaries.

Key Findings:

InceptionV3 was found to be the most accurate and reliable model for detection tasks.

DenseNet strikes a good balance between accuracy and processing speed.

Applications: This project has direct implications for improving security AI systems in agricultural settings, reducing the need for constant manual supervision, and minimizing crop damage.
